# podx3

Linux kernel now contains support for some Line6 PODs, but not X3, and apparently also not for settings manipulation.

This code is partly based on what was already done in http://sourceforge.net/p/line6linux/ (esp. the x3 branch). Some userspace stuff+docs will be dumped here - linux driver modifications will hopefully be kept in linux kernel eventually :-)
